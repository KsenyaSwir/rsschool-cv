3. I'm a stydent of BSUIR, 3 course. My my specialization - electronic engineer-programmer. My dream is to become an independent person, a professional in my field. I want to make the world better, helping others. Benefit people, set goals, push them. I decided that my area of ​​activity would be engineering and programming. That is what i like. I learned in some courses to develop my hard skils: Java-Web and JavaScript courses, epam. Unfurtunately, i didn't passed the last one because of personal reasons. Now i want pass them totaly. I think, that it is cool, that everyone can get programming skills for free, it is good opportunity to acquire the necessary skills, even from scratch, or to improve them.
